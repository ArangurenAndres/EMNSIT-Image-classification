# EMNIST-Image-classification
Evaluation of supervised models for classification models using EMNIST extended dataset

The wide availability
of images has prompted the identification of the
most powerful and accurate algorithms for the task. We
would like to understand which algorithm out of a selected
group(RandomForest, Neural Network(NN) and Convolutional
Neural Network(CNN)) is the most effective in predicting
items from our input data-set. For this task the
extended MNIST image database (EMNIST) is adequate.
Once the best model is discovered we also want to understand
what effect noisy/altered images have on the modelâ€™s
ability to predict correctly.


## Dataset
The dataset used during this project consists on a variant
of the NIST datdaset, called extended MNIST (EMNIST).
IT consists on set of datasets that consitutes a more challenging
classification task involving letters an ddigits, sharing
the same image structure and parameters as the original
MNIST task, hance its compatibility with the already existing
classifiers and systems. The dataset contains handwritten
digits and characters collected from 500 writers. The
database intended to provide a more complex optical character
recognition, therefore presents the data in five separate
organizations.
